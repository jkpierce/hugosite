<main>
<p>In spring I took an 8 day break from work to bike a section of the Arizona trail between Tucson and Phoenix with my friend Andy. This trip was challenging and remote.  We were sometimes an entire day of riding between water sources.</p>

<p><img src="/azt2r.jpg" alt="We didn't set up a tent even once" /></p>

<p>The Sonora desert has astounding diversity. We went to sleep every night listening to owls and doves calling out from the Saguaros. It&rsquo;s not exactly tumbleweed and sand like Western films would have you believe.</p>

<p><img src="/azt3r.jpg" alt="Climbing Mt. Lemmon took an entire day" /></p>

<p>Mt Lemmon is one of the longest climbs I&rsquo;ve done on a bicycle. The reward was escaping the scorching hot lowlands to sleep in beside a flowing creek around ponderosa pines. The next morning, we descended Oracle ridge into Oracle state park on excellent singletrack.</p>

<p><img src="/azt4r.jpg" alt="Oracle Ridge was beautiful until the lightning started" /></p>

<p>The photos skip some days here. We stopped off in the town of Kearny and slept beside the town pond. We woke up and spoke with an old Navajo man who was walking around the pond. He taught us the names of local cacti and shrubs, only some of which I managed to remember, as some names he told us in Navajo. One shrub in particular had a beautiful camphor like scent and yellow flowers. He said &ldquo;this gives you oxygen&rdquo;, as he showed us how he crushed and inhaled it with cupped hands.
Later, when we were tired from pushing our bikes for hours up a mountain, we inhaled the plant as he showed us and found it to increase our clarify of mind and provide an obvious energy rush.</p>

<p><img src="/azt15r.jpg" alt="Gila River Canyon must the lushest place in the Sonora desert" /></p>

<p>Outside of Kearny we got into the Gila and eventually Alamo canyons. This area was some of the best mountainbiking of the trip.</p>

<p><img src="/azt18r.jpg" alt="&quot;The Rincon&quot;" /></p>

<p>There were some incredible views that I&rsquo;m sure my cameraphone doesn&rsquo;t capture in the least.</p>

<p><img src="/azt20r.jpg" alt="Looking out into the Tucson basin" /></p>

<p>The Alamo canyons were incredibly hot and dry. We carried 8L of water each and used almost all of it.</p>

<p><img src="/azt21r.jpg" alt="A photo can't capture the size of this canyon" /></p>

<p>In all this was a beautiful trip. I hope to get the entire month of April free someday to go back and bike the entire trail. Maybe I&rsquo;d even prefer to hike it. Because we biked we had to bypass all of the wilderness areas on dirt roads. Probably these pieces we missed were some of the most beautiful on the trail.</p>
