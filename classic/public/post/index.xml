      <description>Hans Albert Einstein was a civil engineer and the son of Albert Einstein, the famous physicist. In his PhD work before 1937, he performed a series of experiments tracking painted sediment through a model river [1]. His was to understand sediment transport in real rivers.
Einstein recognized that individual grains within the stream move in an alternating sequence of motion and rest periods, and he attempted to characterize the distance of individual motions and the duration of individual rests.</description>

      <description>Malcolm Knapp is the UBC research forest east of Vancouver, and it&amp;rsquo;s home to East Creek, where Michael Church, Marwan Hassan, and a huge group of their grad students and research assistants have studied channel morphology and sediment transport through the decades.
Once when I was out there doing Wolman counts I realized there was probably a maze of gravel roads out there in the research forest, and a year or two later I decided to come back with a bicycle.</description>

      <description>In spring I took an 8 day break from work to bike a section of the Arizona trail between Tucson and Phoenix with my friend Andy. This trip was challenging and remote. We were sometimes an entire day of riding between water sources.
The Sonora desert has astounding diversity. We went to sleep every night listening to owls and doves calling out from the Saguaros. It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly tumbleweed and sand like Western films would have you believe.</description>
