Malcolm Knapp is the UBC research forest east of Vancouver, and it's home to East Creek, where Michael Church, Marwan Hassan, and a huge group of their grad students and research assistants have studied channel morphology and sediment transport through the decades.

Once when I was out there doing Wolman counts I realized there was probably a maze of gravel roads out there in the research forest, and a year or two later I decided to come back with a bicycle. Looking at some maps, I realized there were indeed tons of roads, and I formulated a plan to use them to bike and eventually bushwhack to a place called Raven lake.

Amit and Mary were willing enough to come with, so we drove out to Malcolm Knapp and then biked maybe 15km past the closed gate at night. We eventually camped at the end of a logging road in the middle of a clear cut, as close to Raven Lake as roads go.

The next morning, we woke up and started bushwhacking toward Raven Lake. There was evidence of an old railroad grade, and we loosely followed this, although it was quite swampy and generally grown up with devil's club (an evil spikey plant known to all who bushwhack in BC).

Eventually, we ran out of time to make it back before dark, so we turned around without making it to Raven lake.
We did encounter a different lake, which is probably better described as a tarn/swamp and did not contain much life.

On the way back, we ended up on the downhill side of some cliffs we had been on top of earlier in the day.
This was where the original railroad went. There were remnants of some incredible engineering works: an old viaduct for train tracks was built on the cliff face out of old growth cedars. This must have been incredibly sketchy when it was in use.

After the viaduct, we arrived at the nicest part of the trip: a very big waterfall with a nice plunge pool.

All in all, we failed at the original objective and succeeded in seeing some interesting stuff. We made quick work of the bike ride back to my van.

I'm probably not going back to Malcolm Knapp. Maybe in the future I'll try to get to Raven Lake from bushwhacking up the mountain from the Pitt River.
