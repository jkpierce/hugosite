# James Kevin Pierce

### PhD Candidate in UBC Geography Department

Hi. Thanks for visiting my webpage. You might have chased me down after seeing my work or meeting me at a conference. I'm from a small mountain town in West Virginia, and I study river science using stochastic physics methods at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. [Marwan Hassan](http://blogs.ubc.ca/mhassan/) is my research supervisor.

In my research I develop physically based models of river phenomena with scope to ultimately support efforts to mitigate pollution or manage ecological habitats.
On this webpage you can find links to my publications, my Github and UBC webpages, and some blog posts I've made about science and my other interests.
